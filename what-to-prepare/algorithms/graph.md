**Sparse graph**: E << V<sup>2</sup>

**Dense graph**: E ≈  V<sup>2</sup>

**Representations of graphs**

- **Adjacency lists**: method of choice for sparse graph, memory required Θ(E + V).

- **Adjacency matrix**: may preferred when the graph is dense or we want to tell quickly if there is an edge connecting two given vertices, memory required Θ(V<sup>2</sup>).
