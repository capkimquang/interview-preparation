This is my note while learning about cache in the book [Computer Organization and Design MIPS Edition: The Hardware/Software Interface](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Organization-Design-MIPS-Architecture/dp/0124077269/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1536553502&sr=1-1&keywords=Computer+Organization+and+Design+MIPS+Edition).

There are several concepts that are not clearly explained in the book, like *cache block size* and *byte addressing*. Luckily I found [this lecture notes](lec15.pdf) which also refers to the book ([source](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse378/09wi/lectures/lec15.pdf)).

Read in this order:
- [01 - Memory Hierarchy](01-memory-hierarchy.md).
- [02 - Cache](02-cache.md) (notes for the lecture notes).
