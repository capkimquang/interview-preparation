The *principle of locality* states that programs access a relatively small portion of their address at any instant of time. There are 2 different types of locality:
- Temporal locality (locality in time): if an item is referenced, it will tend to be referenced again soon.
- Spatial locality (locality in space): if an item is referenced, items whose addresses are close by will tend to be referenced soon.

**Memory hierarchy** is a structure that uses multiple levels of memories. The goal is to present the user with as much memory as is available in the cheapest technology, while providing access at the speed offered by the fastest memory.
