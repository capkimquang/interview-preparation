_Note: the following process of answering system design interviews is the intersection of the following resources:

- Book: Cracking the coding interview - Gayle Laakmann McDowell.
- [Book: Designing Data-intensive Applications - Martin Kleppmann](https://github.com/nhannguyen95/interview-preparation/tree/master/notes/system-design/designing-data-intensive-application).
- [Online course: HiredInTech's system design](https://www.hiredintech.com/classrooms/system-design).

and is synthesized by me._
