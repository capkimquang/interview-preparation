_Note: the following process of answering system design interviews is the intersection of the following resources:_

- _Book: Cracking the coding interview - Gayle Laakmann McDowell._
- _[Book: Designing Data-intensive Applications - Martin Kleppmann](https://github.com/nhannguyen95/interview-preparation/tree/master/notes/system-design/designing-data-intensive-application)._
- _[Online course: HiredInTech's system design](https://www.hiredintech.com/classrooms/system-design)._

_and is synthesized by me._
