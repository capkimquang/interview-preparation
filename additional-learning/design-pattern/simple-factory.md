## What it's used for?
- It is not actually a design pattern, some people mistake this idiom for the Factory Pattern.
- Encapsulate creation logic to another class -> one place to make modifications when implementation changes.

## How to use?
- UML:

## Downsides
- Hard to extend if you want to have multiple kinds of SimplePizzaFactory. Abstract Factory could address this in a flexible way.
