**Encapsulate what varies**: Take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extends the parts that vary without affecting those that don't.

**Programming to an supertype (interface, abstract class), not an implementation**: the declared type of the variables should be a supertype, usually an abstract class or interface, so that the objects assigned to those variables can be of any concrete implementation of the supertype, which means the class declaring them doesnâ€™t have to know about the actual object types.

**Favor composition over inheritance**: HAS-A can be better than IS-A

---

**Open-Closed**: Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification => the goal is to allow classes to be easily extended to incorporate new behaviour without modyfing existing code.

Apply to areas that are most likely to change, not everywhere.
