**Encapsulate what varies**: Take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extends the parts that vary without affecting those that don't.

**Programming to an supertype (interface, abstract class), not an implementation**: the declared type of the variables should be a supertype, usually an abstract class or interface, so that the objects assigned to those variables can be of any concrete implementation of the supertype, which means the class declaring them doesnâ€™t have to know about the actual object types.

**Favor composition over inheritance**: HAS-A can be better than IS-A

---

**Open-Closed**: Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification => the goal is to allow classes to be easily extended to incorporate new behaviour without modyfing existing code.

Can be understood as:
- close for modification: not allow anyone to touch your working code.
- open for extension: allow classes to be subclasses and extended.

Apply to areas that are most likely to change, not everywhere.

**Dependency Inversion**: Depend upon abstractions, do not depend upon concrete classes.

  Read Head-First p.139-143.
  
  A few guidelines to help you follow the principle (strive for rather than a rule that you follow all the time):
  - No variable should hold a reference to a concrete class. (use factory to get around that)
  - No class should derive from a concrete class. (derive from an abstraction instead)
  - No method should override an implemented method of any of its base classes.

**Least Knowledge**: talk only to your immediate friends.
  - When you are designing a system, for any object, be careful of the number of classes it interacts with and also how it comes to interact with those classes.
  - This principle prevents us from having a large number of classes coupled together so that changes in one part of the system cascade to other parts.
  
The guidelines to help you follow this principle: take any object; from any method in that object, we should invoke methods that belong to:
  - The object it self.
  - Object passed in a parameter to the method.
  - Any object the method creates or instantiates.
  - Any components of the object.
  
  Note that we shouldn't call methods on objects that were returned from calling other methods:
  
  Without principle:
  ```
  getTemp()
    Thermometer thermometer = station.getThermometer();
    return thermometer.getTemperature();
  ```
  
  With principle, ask the station object to make request for us:
  ```
  getTemp()
    return station.getTemperature();
  ```

**Hollywood**: Don't call us, we'll call you.

We allow low-level components to hook themselves into a system, but the high-level components determine when they are needed, and how. In other words, the high-level components give the low-level ones a "don't call us, we'll call you" treatment.

**A class should have only 1 reason to change**. The principle guides us to assign each responsibility to 1 class, and only 1 class.
