Use case:
- `Duck` base class (an abstract or normal class), there are many types of duck (subclasses) inherit from `Duck`.
- Some types of duck can fly, some types of duck can quack. There are also different types of fly behavior and quack behavior too.
- In this case, we shouldn't put fly and duck into `Duck` base class, since not that every types of duck need them.
- We need to separate fly and duck behavior out of `Duck` base class by having them in a separated set of classes that inherit from `FlyBehavior` and `QuackBehavior` supertype. Then in `Duck` base class we will have 2 instances of them, and 2 methods `performFly` and `performQuack` that use those 2 to perform fly and quack.
- Now the subclass of `Duck` only need to assign the specific type of behavior they want for the 2 instances.

**Principle - Encapsulate what varies**: Take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extends the parts that vary without affecting those that don't.

---

**Principle - Programming to an supertype (interface, abstract class), not an implementation**: the declared type of the variables should be a supertype, usually an abstract class or interface, so that the objects assigned to those variables can be of any concrete implementation of the supertype, which means the class declaring them doesnâ€™t have to know about the actual object types.

```java
// Programming to implementation:
Dog dog = new Dog()
dog.bark()

// Programming to supertype
Animal animal = new Dog()
animal.makeSound()  // Dog's makeSound implements Animal's makeSound
```

**Principle - Favor composition over inheritance**: HAS-A can be better than IS-A. (`Duck` has `FlyBehavior` and `QuackBehavior`).

One of the secrets to creating maintainable OO systems is thinking about how they might change in the future and these principles address those issues.

**Strategy pattern**: defines a family of algorithms (behaviors), encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangable. Strategy lets the algorithm independently from clients that use it.
