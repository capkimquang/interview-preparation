## Digital Cryptography

- Ciphers: Algorithms for *encoding* text to make it unreadable to voyeur.
- Keys: Numeric parameters that change the behavior of ciphers.
- **Symmetric-key cryptosystems** (Mã hoá đối xứng): algorithms that use the same key for encoding and decoding.
- **Asymmetric-key cryptosystems** (Mã hoá bất đối xứng): algorithms that use different keys for encoding and decoding.
- **Public-key cryptography**: A system making it easy for millions of computers to send secret messages.
- **Digital signatures**: Checksums that verify that a message has not been forged or tampered with.
- **Digital certificates**: Identifying information, verified and signed by a trusted organization.
