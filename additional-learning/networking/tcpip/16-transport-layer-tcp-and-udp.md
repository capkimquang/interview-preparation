Transport Layer means Application-to-Application connections: it allows the communication between two applications on two different computers.

**Port** ID (or port) is an 16-bit integer (0 - 65535). When the computer receives an IP packet from any other device, it will send the payload to the right application based on the Port ID

**Socket** = IP address + port, 2 sockets uniqueqly identify a TCP connection.

The Protocol Data Unit (PDU) at this layer is **Segment** (or **Datagram**), the header of the segment is different if the protocol used is TCP or UDP, but 2 fields are always present: [source Port ID and destination port ID](https://www.ictshore.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/1016-05-Segment.png).

**Transport Layer Port ranges*

|Range name|Range|Description|
|-|-|-|
|Well-known|0-1023|Used for popular service (HTTP, FTP etc.)
|Reserved|1024-49151|Used for service applications (the ones running on servers)| 
|Dynamic|49152-65535|Ports in this range are used by client application as they do not need a specific Port ID,but instead just any port to be able to make requests to servers|

## TCP

**Transmission Control Protocol**:
- has been designed with a major goal: ensure a **reliable** delivery of data between remote applications.
  > This is possible because the receiver notifies the sender when it receives data and, in case it doesnâ€™t, there is a mechanism that triggers the sender to re-transmit data that was not received.
- is a **connection-oriented** protocol, which means that the 2 application must establish a connection before they can actually start to exchange data.
- grants **ordered delivery**: data arrives in the order they were sent, if not they are reordered by the receiver.

### [TCP header](https://www.ictshore.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/1016-07-TCP_segment.png)

All the above features are possible thanks to the implementation of TCP with a dedicated header in the segment and with specific algorithms that run on the computer that is using TCP to talk:
- **Source Port**
- **Destination Port**
- **Sequence number**: in TCP, we send a *stream of bytes*, this field identifies to which byte in the full stream the first byte of the TCP payload corresponds to.
- **Acknowledgement number**: this field is used by the receiver to tell the sender that it has received some data. It is populated with the byte number the receiver expect to see next after what it already received.
- **Flags**:
  - **ACK** (Acknowledgement): Set to 1 from the receiver to tell the sender to check out the Acknowledgment number field.
  - **RST** (Reset): Inform the other device that the connection is being closed immediatly (hard reset of the connection).
  - **SYN** (Sync): Used to establish a connection.
  - **FIN** (Finish): Used to gracefully close a connection.
- **Check sum**: hash of the entire segment used by the receiver to verify that no errors happened during the transmission.

### [TCP Three-way handshake procedure](https://www.ictshore.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/1016-06-Three_way_handshake.png)

This procedure involves 3 exchanges of data, assume that device A wants to talk to device B:
- Step 1: A sends an emtpy TCP segment with the *SYN flag set to 1*, this segment contains only the source and destination ports and that flat set.
- Step 2: If the application on B is willing to respond to A, B will send back an empty segment with the ports specified, the *SYN and ACK flag set to 1*, implies that B got the request and is willing to open the connection.
- Step 3: A sends back to B with the *ACK flag set to 1*. After that, the connection is successfully established and 2 devices can start exchanging data.

### The data transfer

The data is received in the order they were sent with the aid of the `Sequence number` field. When an application is sending data to another, the sequence number is used to tell what is the position of the first data byte being send (the first byte of the payload) in the entire data stream.

The data is transfered reliable with the aid of the [`Acknowledgement number`](https://www.ictshore.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/1016-09-acknoledgment.png): Let say A wants to send 1000 bytes, but can only sends 100 bytes at a time. So the first sequence number is 0, the second is 100 and so on.

The *retransmission* is triggered in three cases:
- When the sender do not receive acknowledgement segments (timeout):
  > When A sends a segment, it waits for an acknowledgement from B stating that B has received the segment.
- When the receiver misses a segment:
  > If B has missed a segment but the next one was correctly received (for example B received 0-100, 200-300; it knows 100-200 is missed), B will send back to A an acknowledgement number of 100, meaning that B has received correctly the first 100 bytes, A needs to retransmiss the missed segment 100-200 *(and all segments after this)*; in the meantime, **all the received segments after that will be discarded** (this is obviously not the optimal behaviour,  but it is the one *used in the most basic implementations* that do not rely on *Selective Acknowledgment*). This way all data will be delivered reliably. 
- When the receiver verifies that the checksum do not match the segment.
