A **network topology** is the representation of links between the nodes within a network:
  - A node is any device that can be plugged into a network and communicating within the network: it does not matter how it can be plugged in (with a cable, in Wi-Fi and so on)
    > a PC, a router, a smartphone, a laptop, a switch, etc.
  - A link is any type of connection that can allow two devices to talk.
    > a coaxial cable, an ethernet cable, a fiber optic cable, a wireless connection, etc.
