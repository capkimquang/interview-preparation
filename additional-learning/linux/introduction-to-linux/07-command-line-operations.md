sudo allows users to run programs using the security privileges of another user, generally root (superuser).

Create a hard (symbolic) link `file2` on `file1`: `ln file1 file2`.

Create a soft (symbolic) link `file3` on `file1`: `ln -s file1 file3`.

Symbolic links take no extra space on the filesystem (unless their names are very long). They are extremely convenient, as they can easily be modified to point to different places. An easy way to create a shortcut from your home directory to long pathnames is to create a symbolic link.

Unlike hard links, soft links can point to objects even on different filesystems, partitions, and/or disks and other media,  which may or may not be currently available or even exist. In the case where the link does not point to a currently available or existing object, you obtain a dangling link.

`cat`: Used for viewing files that are not very long; it does not provide any scroll-back.

`less`: Used to view larger files because it is a paging program. It pauses at each screen full of text, provides scroll-back capabilities, and lets you search and navigate within the file. Note: Use / to search for a pattern in the forward direction and ? for a pattern in the backward direction.

---

To set the date and timestamp of a file to a specific value: `touch -t 12091600 myfile`.

## Searching for files

### Standard File Streams

When commands are executed, by default there are three standard file streams (or *descriptors*) always open for use: standard input (standard in or stdin), standard output (standard out or stdout) and standard error (or stderr).

Usually, stdin is your keyboard, and stdout and stderr are printed on your terminal.

In Linux, all open files are represented internally by what are called file descriptors. Simply put, these are represented by numbers starting at zero. stdin is file descriptor 0, stdout is file descriptor 1, and stderr is file descriptor 2. Typically, if other files are opened in addition to these three, *which are opened by default*, they will start at file descriptor 3 and increase from there.

### I/O Redirection

If we have a program called **do_something** that reads from stdin and writes to stdout and stderr:

We can change its input source by using the less-than sign:

```do_something < input-file```

If you want to send the output to a file, use the greater-than sign:

```
do_something > output-file

Note: Because stderr is not the same as stdout, error messages will still be seen on the terminal windows in the above command
```

If you want to redirect stderr to a separate file, you use stderrâ€™s file descriptor number:

```
do_something 2> error-file

Note: do_something 1> output-file = do_something > output-file
```

A special shorthand notation can send anything written to file descriptor 2 (stderr) to the same place as file descriptor 1 (stdout):

```
do_something > all-output-file 2>&1

An alternative in bash:
do_something >& all-output-file
```

### Pipes

You can pipe the *output* of one command or program into another as its input:

```
command1 | command2 | command3
```
