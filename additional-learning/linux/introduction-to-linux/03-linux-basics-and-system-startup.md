## The Linux kernel

When the kernel is loaded in RAM, it immediately initializes and configures the computerâ€™s memory and also configures all the hardware attached to the system. This includes all processors, I/O subsystems, storage devices, etc. The kernel also loads some necessary user space applications.

The kernel then runs `/sbin/init`, this then becomes the initial process. `init`:
- starts other processes to get the system running.
- is responsible for keeping the system running and for shutting it down cleanly.

Traditionally, this process startup was done using conventions that date back to the 1980s and the System V variety of UNIX. However, all major recent distributions have moved away from this and adopted systemd instead.

## systemd

Systems with systemd start up faster than those with earlier init methods. This is largely because it replaces a serialized set of steps with aggressive parallelization techniques, which permits multiple services to be initiated simultaneously.

`/sbin/init` now just points to `/lib/systemd/systemd`; i.e. systemd takes over the init process.
