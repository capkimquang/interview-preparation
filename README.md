# Advices

- _"The truth is that you are never going to feel fully prepared."_

- _"Majority candidates know what DFS/BFS is. What makes a difference is to have a deep understanding of those concepts."_

- _"You should be clear about the definition of those basic data structures/algorithms. Most people did a good job in this part, but not perfect. For instance, a lot of people are confused about dynamic programming and recursion."_

- _"Try to compare relevant data structures/algorithms and understand their pros and cons. A good example is BFS and DFS."_

- Which algorithm is better in what case?
