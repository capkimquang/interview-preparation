# [Interview strategies](https://github.com/nhannguyen95/interview-preparation/tree/master/strategies)

- [System design](strategies/system-design.md).

# Advices:

- _"The truth is that you are never going to feel fully prepared."_

- _"Majority candidates know what DFS/BFS is. What makes a difference is to have a deep understanding of those concepts."

- _"You should be clear about the definition of those basic data structures/algorithms. Most people did a good job in this part, but not perfect. For instance, a lot of people are confused about dynamic programming and recursion."_

- _"Try to compare relevant data structures/algorithms and understand their pros and cons. A good example is BFS and DFS."_

- Which algorithm is better in what case?
